This folder contains climate data for "BEC variant centroid surrogates": locations within each BEC variant that have multivariate climate attributes very similar to the average climate across the spatial distribution of the BEC variant. 
all data are extracted from ClimateWNA. 
the basemap for BEC variants is BEC version 10 (beta) sent to me by Will Mackenzie.
