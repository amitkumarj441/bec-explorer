# BEC Explorer

## About 
The BEC Climate Explorer is a project to build an interactive data viewer for the Biogeoclimate Ecosystem Classification (BEC) zones in North America. The BEC Climate zones "provides immense value as a baseline ecological condition to assess the affects of climate change" but currently there are few/no resources available for researchers working with the BEC zones (e.g. ecologists, foresters, etc) to explore this massive dataset without using desktop GIS tools. The idea is to start building a web based interface for researchers to explore the data.
