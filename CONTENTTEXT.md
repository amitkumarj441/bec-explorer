Welcome to the BEC Climate Explorer. This web tool helps you dig deep into the climates of British Columbia—past, present, and future. The heart of this tool is the Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (BEC). BEC differentiates more than 200 climate types—a richly detailed map of British Columbia’s climatic diversity. Use this tool to explore the climates of BC, compare them to each other, and see how they are changing over time. 



**[About Page]**

The [Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification](https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hre/becweb/ "BECweb") is the foundation for ecosystem management in British Columbia. It is a classification of key abiotic drivers of ecosystem function into climatic units (BGC subzone-variants) and site units (BGC site series) that resource managers and policy-makers treat as the basic units of forest management. BGC units are the basis for tree species selection, silvicultural systems, soil sensitivity assessments, fire hazard mapping, legislated stocking standards, protected area system priorities, and many other areas of planning and practice. Practitioner knowledge of the climatic and ecological dynamics of these units is extensive but predominantly qualitative, and even intuitive amongst some practitioners. The past decade has seen the emergence of an abundance of climate data, most notably through [ClimateBC](http://cfcg.forestry.ubc.ca/projects/climate-data/climatebcwna/). This newly available data gives us the opportunity to improve our quantitative understanding of BEC climate units. In a changing climate, there is an increasing need to bridge the gap between the qualitative ecological knowledge encoded by the BEC system, and the quantitative data provided by climate models. 

The purpose of this tool is to help citizens and BEC practitioners to translate raw climate data into ecological insight. Our approach is primarily graphical—we provide many different ways of visualizing the data. We also believe that comparison is critical to learning, and have provided the means for comparison across different BEC units. As we develop the tool further, we aim to include ways for users to contribute their own knowledge… stay tuned. 

**Methods**

All climate data used in this site are downloaded from [ClimateBC](http://cfcg.forestry.ubc.ca/projects/climate-data/climatebcwna/). Climate data for each BEC unit were extracted from ClimateBC at a single location representing the average climatic conditions of that unit. The BEC linework is generalized from Version 10 (beta) of the Biogeoclimatic Subzone/Variant (BGC) Mapping, obtained under the[ Open Government License – British Columbia](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/about-the-bc-government/databc/open-data/open-government-license-bc). We subdivided very large coastal subzones—the CWHvm and MHmm—into three regional subunits: a “South Coast” subunit southeast of Bute inlet (e.g. CWHvm1s), a “West Coast” subunit on Vancouver island (e.g. CWHvm1w), and a “North Coast” subunit northwest of Bute Inlet (e.g. CWHvm1n).

***Colin Mahony (concept, data, and scientific direction)*** is a Registered Professional Forester on academic leave to do a PhD at the UBC Faculty of Forestry. [His research](http://colinmahony.wix.com/forestclimates) investigates novel climates--new climate types with no analog in the observed climates of BC and North America. Colin is a BEC practitioner with experience in silviculture and site identification on the BC Coast, the Cariboo, and the Kootenays. Colin's contributions to this project are funded by a multi-year Fellowship from [TerreWEB](http://terreweb.ubc.ca/), an NSERC CREATE program that supports communication of global change science. 

***Joey Lee (web design and development)*** is a geographer and computational media artist from San Francisco, California. He is passionate about technological literacy and the engagement of art and science through computation and collaboration. Joey is co-author of "[The Big Atlas of LA Pools](http://jk-lee.com/the-big-atlas-of-la-pools/)" and co-creator of the ["Aerial Bold" Kickstarter project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/357538735/aerial-bold-kickstart-the-planetary-search-for-let) ([video here](https://vimeo.com/108875406)). He is currently based in Vancouver, Canada, balancing his time between his [MSc research](http://joeyklee.github.io/presentations/ubc_springsymposium2015/#/15) and teaching at the University of British Columbia, building workshops around opensource tools (e.g. Maptime Vancouver), and exploring projects around geography and technology. Joey’s contributions to this project are funded by [Mozilla Fellowships for Science](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/fellowships), a program supporting community-level open science and data-sharing.
