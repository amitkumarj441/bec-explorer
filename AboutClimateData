## Climate map: The Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (BEC) 

The Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (Pojar et al. 1987) is the foundation for ecosystem management in British Columbia. It is a classification of key abiotic drivers of ecosystem function into climatic units (BGC subzone-variants) and site units (BGC site series) that resource managers and policy-makers treat as the basic units of forest management. BGC units are the basis for tree species selection, silvicultural systems, soil sensitivity assessments, fire hazard mapping, legislated stocking standards, protected area system priorities, and many other areas of planning and practice. Among its many features, BEC provides a detailed map of climate types based on observations of vegetation communities. We've used the >200 units of the BEC climate map as the basis for this tool. 

### BEC unit names

The names of the BEC units reflect a hierarchical climate classification. The core unit of the climate classification is the BEC subzone. Subzones are aggregated into 14 BEC zones, and in some cases are subdivided into variants and phases. For example, the IDFdk1a unit is the code for the "grassland" *phase* of the "Thompson" *variant* of the "dry, cool" *subzone* of the "Interior Douglas-fir" *zone*. Some BEC units do not have variants or phases, for example the coastal western hemlock dry maritime subzone (CWHdm). Selkirk College provides a [good introduction](http://selkirk.ca/discover/bec/zones/whatis.html) to the BEC climate classification system. [BECWeb](https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/HRE/becweb/index.html) provides [detailed descriptions of each BEC unit](https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/HRE/becweb/resources/classificationreports/subzones/index.html), along with a wealth of other information about the BEC system. 

### One location for each BEC unit

This tool provides climatic information for 233 locations across British Columbia -- one location for each BEC unit. As a result, the data presented for each BEC unit is actually the climate of a single location within that unit. This was a necessary simplification in building this tool. It's a reasonable approach, since BEC units by definition are somewhat climatically homogeneous: the climatic variation can generally be expected to be lower within than between BEC units. We took care in choosing the representative locations for the BEC units, and subdivided very large BEC units to ensure that regional differences were accounted for. Nevertheless, comparisons between similar BEC units may be biased for certain variables due to the choice of representative locations. 

### Simplified linework 

To make this tool work on the web, we have simplified the BEC climate map substantially. BEC climate maps and spatial data are freely available at [BECWeb](https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/HRE/becweb/resources/maps/CartographicProducts.html). 

## Climate Variables

Users of this tool have the ability to choose from many climate variables. We define climate variables in terms of a climate element (e.g. temperature, precipitation, degree days, etc.) and a time aggregate (e.g. winter, spring, january, etc.). Some of the climate elements, such as temperature and precipitation, are broadly relevant to many contexts. Others are relevant to specific applications: degree-days above 5 degrees and below 0 degrees celsius are relevant to plant development; degree-days above & below 18 degrees celsius are used by building engineers to assess cooling and heating demand.
