# Roadmap

## Project Scoping

This document outlines the evolving goals of the BEC Explorer. 

## Short/Mid Term

* Develop **map based visualization**, data explorer of the BEC data:
	* Figure out workflow to go from massive shapefile to an interactive map layer.
	* Build in map based queries (could be a cartodb thing?) - also link to interactive graphs for filtering
	* png/pdf export of graph for static use
* Develop **complementary graphs** for sorting and filtering map data:
	* Interactive graphs to work with variables of dataset
	* png/pdf export of graph for non-web based use
* Develop **"BEC Stories"** to highlight features of dataset:
	* e.g. Vancouver climate analogs? 

## Long Term

* Create workflow for shp to web geo 
* png/pdf export of graph for static use
